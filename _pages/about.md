Bio:
------
I am currently a professor of School of Computer Science and Technology at [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), working with Professor [Xiuzhen Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1yGhH0AAAAJ&hl=en). Before joining Shandong University, I was a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/) (2024 - 2025). I spent three years as a postdoc researcher at The [Ohio State University (OSU)](http://www.osu.edu/) (2020 - 2023), working with Prof. [Zhiqiang Lin](https://zhiqlin.github.io/). Before coming to OSU, I graduated from [Jinan University](https://www.jnu.edu.cn/main.htm) (2016 - 2020),  under the supervision of [Jian Weng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7xRkSZAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Weiqi Luo](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/2012/0709/c2027a48148/page.htm).    Also, I ever visited/worked at  [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu/) / [University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)](https://www.uml.edu/) (2018 -2020),  under the supervision of  [Xinwen Fu](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/index.html).
